const proBlurb = `This is a pro description where the bio talks about how the pro began climbing in 1997 and has been a prominent force in the climbing community for the last decade.

Growing up in the competition scene, this pro has consistently been a member of the US Team since 2001, winning this pro's first Youth Climbing National Championship at age twelve (2002), Adult National Championship at age thirteen (2003), and won a silver medal at the Youth World Championships in Scotland at age fourteen (2004).

In 2008 this pro made history by becoming the first American to win a Bouldering World Cup on US soil. In 2010 this pro did it again, winning gold in Switzerland, becoming only the second American pro to win a Bouldering World Cup overseas.

Since then, this pro has shifted this pro's focus away from competitions and honed in on outdoor projects, building an impressive tick-list filled with dozens of iconic first pro ascents. including V12s like Clear Blue Skies in Colorado, The Mandala in Bishop, and Book of Nightmares in Red Rock. This has also spent time getting off the deck climbing highballs like Diesel Power (V10) in Yosemite, Golden Showers (V10), and flashing the infamously dangerous, Luminance(V10) in Bishop, California.

In 2014 this pro relocated to Las Vegas, NV, an area with unlimited climbing, and potential for new development. In Red Rock, this pro has already contributed to the establishment of more world class climbing with this pro's first ascents of Critically Acclaimed, a stunning V9/10 highball, and most recently, The Swoop V10, a dynamic problem over a sketchy landing.`
