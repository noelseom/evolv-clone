Here, veganism took root in America, surfing became mainstream, and the z-boys birthed modern skate culture. We created Evolv to bring this progressive attitude towards climbing. With this, Evolv has created the best rock climbing shoes out there in the market. Applying the ethos of incremental improvement to the design of technical climbing shoes and to apmplify the creative voices that make up our diverse community of climbers So everything we do is an expression of climbers' creativity and approached with the freedom to experiment. Crafting the best designed climbing shoes, street shoes, crashpads and more while keeping comfort, performance and passion in mind. To try, and fail, and try again, pushing progression through creative climbing projects.`
